# SVM Classification with Iris Dataset

## Short Description
This project shows how to create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the Iris dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayparekh07/iris-svm-classification.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd iris-svm-classification
   ```
Install the required libraries:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Tests: 

The notebook includes tests for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

Breakdown of tests

Data preprocessing: ItÂ ensures that the data is correctly separated and normalized.
Model Training: Verifies that the SVM classifier was trained correctly.
Evaluation: Contains accuracy and confusion matrix tests to analyze the classifier's performance.

Deployment:  

This project is designed to be run locally with Jupyter Notebook. There are no additional deployment processes required.
